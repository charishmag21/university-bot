I'd be happy to help you understand the admission requirements for Northeastern University Toronto.\n\nFor undergraduate programs, Northeastern University is test-optional, meaning you don't have to submit SAT or ACT scores. However, they will consider your high school grades and the courses you've taken. The middle 50% range SAT score of admitted students is 1480-1540, and the middle 50% range GPA is 4.2-4.5, giving you an idea of the academic rigor.\n\nFor graduate programs, the university requires a minimum IELTS score of 6.5, a TOEFL score of 79, or a PTE score of 53. \n\nPlease note that these are general guidelines and specific programs may have additional requirements.
